several phonological changes then take place:
    - /f/ and /v/ are lost and merge with /p/ and /b/ (and stop being written separately)
    - /q/ and /k/ merge
    - guttural/glottal fricative chain shift:
    -- /h/ voices to /ɦ/
    -- /x/ softens/debuccalizes to /h/ (and disappears after /n/ [ŋ], shifting /nx/ to /ŋ/)
    -- /χ/ and /ʁ/ soften to /x/ and /ɰ/
    --- similar to istanbul turkish, /ɰ/ starts to fade and takes on more of a vowel-lengthening/-strengthening role
    - /s/ and /z/ palatalize to [ʃ] and [ʒ] before front vowels and in coda position after front vowels. this becomes phonemic after the vowel shift
    -- this change is reflected in the orthography with ş and ž for ʃ and ʒ, but most grammatical suffixes that end in s or z remain written with s and z for two reasons:
    --- 1. they are only pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when the vowel harmony of the suffix generates a front vowel before the s/z
    --- 2. they are not pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when followed by another suffix if that causes the s/z to no longer be in coda position (note: a ş/ž in a *root* does not stop being /ʃ/ or /ʒ/ when proceeded by a suffix that causes it to no longer be in coda position. this rule only affects suffixes)
    -- so the shift to /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ can be looked at in two parts, one in roots and one in grammatical suffixes, the latter of which is less of a phonemic distinction and more of an alternation and thus goes unwritten.
    - a significant vowel shift occurs:
    -- the back vowels get fronted and /ɑ/ and /o/ raise: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /ɨ/ /ʉ/ /ə²/ /u/
    -- before /ɰ/, the prior change does not happen and the back vowels instead merge in roundedness: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /u/ /u/ /o/ /o/
    -- the front vowels get lowered: /i/ /y/ /e/ /ø/ => /e/ /ø/ /a/ /ə¹/ (proto /ø/ and /ɑ/ merge to schwa but retain separate function in the vowel harmony system)
    - historical /ɰ/ disappears:
    -- in syllable onset /ɰ/ becomes /ɦ/, + length on the preceding vowel (minus the previously given effects on the vowel shift)
    -- elsewhere it disappears entirely except for the vowel length effect
    -- in summary, /ɰV/ => /ɦV/, /V¹ɰV²/ => /V¹ːɦV²/, /VɰC/ => /VːC/
    - word-initial /ɾ/ ends up merging with /ʒ/ (cf. behavior of turkish /ɾ/ word-initially and utterance-finally)
    - word-final plosives devoice
    - coda velar plosives become realized as /x/

then some changes happen to the spelling:
    - since <ö> and <a> have merged (transcribed as /ə¹/ and /ə²/ respectively; phonetically interchangeable but function differently for vowel harmony), people stop writing <ö> and start using <a> instead for /ə/ in all circumstances.
    -- for long /əː/ <öǧ> from historical /øɰ/, this starts being written as <aǧ>, which conflicts with long /oː/ from historical /ɑɰ/ or /oɰ/ which is written either <aǧ> or <oǧ>. so now you have /əː/ <aǧ>, /oː/ <aǧ>, and /oː/ <oǧ>
    - <ň> starts being used for writing /ŋ/ instead of <n> in places where /ŋ/ originated from assimilation, not just from original phonemic distinctions. /ŋ/ from proto /nx/ remains written as <nh> though since the <h> is already there to denote the /ŋ/
