several phonological changes then take place:
    - /f/ is lost and merges with /p/
    - /q/ and /k/ merge
    - guttural/glottal fricative chain shift:
    -- /h/ voices to /ɦ/
    -- /x/ softens/debuccalizes to /h/ (and disappears after /n/ [ŋ], shifting /nx/ to /ŋ/)
    -- /χ/ and /ʁ/ soften to /x/ and /ɰ/
    --- similar to istanbul turkish, /ɰ/ starts to fade and takes on more of a vowel-lengthening/-strengthening role
    - /s/ and /z/ palatalize to [ʃ] and [ʒ] before front vowels and in coda position after front vowels. this becomes phonemic after the vowel shift
    -- this change is reflected in the orthography with ş and ž for /ʃ/ and /ʒ/, but most roots that end in s or z and most grammatical affixes that contain s or z remain written with s and z for two reasons:
    --- 1. they are not pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when followed by something else if that causes the s/z to no longer be in coda position
    --- 2. (in affixes) they are only pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when the vowel harmony of the affix generates a front vowel before/after the s/z. this doesn't apply to F vowels
    - the word for "one" /ɦɑj/ when used as an indefinite marker before a noun causes a lenition effect as described in the lenition section (resulting in the genesis of /ɲ/)
    - /ɲ/ gets lost in favor of /niɦ/
    - a significant vowel shift occurs:
    -- the back vowels get fronted and /ɑ/ and /o/ raise: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /ɨ/ /ʉ/ /ə²/ /u/
    -- before /ɰ/, the prior change does not happen and the back vowels instead merge in roundedness: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /u/ /u/ /o/ /o/
    -- the front vowels get lowered: /i/ /y/ /e/ /ø/ => /e/ /ø/ /a/ /ə¹/ (proto /ø/ and /ɑ/ merge to schwa but retain separate function in the vowel harmony system)
    - historical /ɰ/ disappears:
    -- in syllable onset /ɰ/ becomes /ɦ/, + length on the preceding vowel (minus the previously given effects on the vowel shift)
    -- elsewhere it disappears entirely except for the vowel length effect
    -- in summary, /ɰV/ => /ɦV/, /V¹ɰV²/ => /V¹ːɦV²/, /VɰC/ => /VːC/
    - word-initial /ɾ/ ends up merging with /ʒ/ (cf. behavior of turkish /ɾ/ word-initially and utterance-finally)
    - word-final plosives devoice and coda position velar plosives lenite to /x/. both these changes result in (unwritten) consonant alternation effects

then some changes happen to the spelling:
    - the word-initial consonant changes from consonant mutation and /ɾ/ => /ʒ/ get mildly reformed in the orthography. consonant mutation is spelled phonetically and /ʒ/ from initial /ɾ/ gets written with ř
    - since <ö> and <a> have merged (transcribed as /ə¹/ and /ə²/ respectively; phonetically interchangeable but function differently for vowel harmony), people stop writing <ö> and start using <a> instead for /ə/ in all circumstances.
    -- for long /əː/ <öǧ> from historical /øɰ/, this starts being written as <aǧ>, which conflicts with long /oː/ from historical /ɑɰ/ or /oɰ/ which is written either <aǧ> or <oǧ>. so now you have /əː/ <aǧ>, /oː/ <aǧ>, and /oː/ <oǧ>
    - <ň> starts being used for writing /ŋ/ instead of <n> in places where /ŋ/ originated from assimilation, not just from original phonemic distinctions. /ŋ/ from proto /nx/ remains written as <nh> though since the <h> is already there to denote the /ŋ/
