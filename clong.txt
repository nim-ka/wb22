several phonological changes then take place:
    - /f/ is lost and merges with /p/
    - /q/ and /k/ merge
    - guttural/glottal fricative chain shift:
    -- /h/ voices to /ɦ/
    -- /x/ softens/debuccalizes to /h/ (and disappears after /n/ [ŋ], shifting /nx/ to /ŋ/)
    -- /χ/ and /ʁ/ soften to /x/ and /ɰ/
    --- similar to istanbul turkish, /ɰ/ starts to fade and takes on more of a vowel-lengthening/-strengthening role
    - /s/ and /z/ palatalize to [ʃ] and [ʒ] before front vowels and in coda position after front vowels. this becomes phonemic after the vowel shift
    -- this change is reflected in the orthography with ş and ž for /ʃ/ and /ʒ/, but most roots that end in s or z and most grammatical affixes that contain s or z remain written with s and z for two reasons:
    --- 1. they are not pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when followed by something else if that causes the s/z to no longer be in coda position
    --- 2. (in affixes) they are only pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when the vowel harmony of the affix generates a front vowel before/after the s/z. this doesn't apply to F vowels
    - the word for "one" /ɦɑj/ when used as an indefinite marker before a noun causes a lenition effect as described in the lenition section (resulting in the genesis of /ɲ/)
    - /ɲ/ gets lost in favor of /niɦ/
    - a significant vowel shift occurs:
    -- the back vowels get fronted and /ɑ/ and /o/ raise: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /ɨ/ /ʉ/ /ə²/ /u/
    -- before /ɰ/, the prior change does not happen and the back vowels instead merge in roundedness: /ɯ/ /u/ /ɑ/ /o/ => /u/ /u/ /o/ /o/
    -- the front vowels get lowered: /i/ /y/ /e/ /ø/ => /e/ /ø/ /a/ /ə¹/ (proto /ø/ and /ɑ/ merge to schwa but retain separate function in the vowel harmony system)
    - historical /ɰ/ disappears:
    -- in syllable onset /ɰ/ becomes /ɦ/, + length on the preceding vowel (minus the previously given effects on the vowel shift)
    -- elsewhere it disappears entirely except for the vowel length effect
    -- in summary, /ɰV/ => /ɦV/, /V¹ɰV²/ => /V¹ːɦV²/, /VɰC/ => /VːC/
    - word-initial /ɾ/ ends up merging with /ʒ/ (cf. behavior of turkish /ɾ/ word-initially and utterance-finally)
    - word-final plosives devoice and coda position velar plosives lenite to /x/. both these changes result in (unwritten) consonant alternation effects

then some changes happen to the spelling:
    - the word-initial consonant changes from consonant mutation and /ɾ/ => /ʒ/ get mildly reformed in the orthography. consonant mutation is spelled phonetically and /ʒ/ from initial /ɾ/ gets written with ř
    - since <ö> and <a> have merged (transcribed as /ə¹/ and /ə²/ respectively; phonetically interchangeable but function differently for vowel harmony), people stop writing <ö> and start using <a> instead for /ə/ in all circumstances.
    -- for long /əː/ <öǧ> from historical /øɰ/, this starts being written as <aǧ>, which conflicts with long /oː/ from historical /ɑɰ/ or /oɰ/ which is written either <aǧ> or <oǧ>. so now you have /əː/ <aǧ>, /oː/ <aǧ>, and /oː/ <oǧ>
    - <ň> starts being used for writing /ŋ/ instead of <n> in places where /ŋ/ originated from assimilation, not just from original phonemic distinctions. /ŋ/ from proto /nx/ remains written as <nh> though since the <h> is already there to denote the /ŋ/

lenition:
    the word for 1, "ay" /ɦɑj/, when used as an indefinite marker before nouns begins to cause lenition on following consonants, as so:
        ɦɑj m* "ay m*" ==>  ɦɑ m* "a m*"
        ɦɑj n* "ay n*" ==>  ɦɑ ɲ* ==> ɦɑ niɦ* "a ni*"
        ɦɑj ŋ* "ay ň*" ==>  ɦɑ n* "a n*"
        ɦɑj p* "ay p*" ==>  ɦɑ b* "a b*"
        ɦɑj b* "ay b*" ==>  ɦɑ b* "a b*"
        ɦɑj t* "ay t*" ==>  ɦɑ s* "a s*"
        ɦɑj d* "ay d*" ==>  ɦɑ z* "a z*"
       ɦɑj tʃ* "ay ç*" ==>  ɦɑ ʃ* "a ş*"
       ɦɑj dʒ* "ay c*" ==>  ɦɑ ʒ* "a ž*"
        ɦɑj k* "ay k*" ==> ɦɑ tʃ* "a ç*"
        ɦɑj g* "ay g*" ==> ɦɑ dʒ* "a c*"
        ɦɑj v* "ay v*" ==>  ɦɑ v* "a v*"
        ɦɑj s* "ay s*" ==>  ɦɑ ʃ* "a ş*"
        ɦɑj z* "ay z*" ==>  ɦɑ ʒ* "a ž*"
        ɦɑj ʃ* "ay ş*" ==>  ɦɑ ʃ* "a ş*"
        ɦɑj ʒ* "ay ž*" ==>  ɦɑ ʒ* "a ž*"
        ɦɑj x* "ay ħ*" ==>  ɦɑ j* "a y*"
        ɦɑj h* "ay h*" ==>  ɦɑ h* "a h*"
        ɦɑj ɦ* "ay *"  ==>  ɦɑ ɦ* "a *"
        ɦɑj l* "ay l*" ==> before front vowels: ɦɑ j* "a y*"
                           before back vowels:  ɦɑ ɰ* "a ǧ*" ==> ɦɑ ɦ* "a ǧ*"
        ɦɑj j* "ay y*" ==>  ɦɑ j* "a y*"
        ɦɑj ɾ* "ay r*" ==>  ɦɑ ʒ* "a ř*"

phonology:
    consonants:
        m       n               ŋ
        p/b     t/d     tʃ/dʒ   k/g
        v       s/z     ʃ/ʒ     x       h/ɦ
                l       j
                ɾ
    
    /n/, /t/, /d/, /l/, and /ɾ/ are denti-alveolar
    word-final plosives are devoiced. /k/ and /g/ are lenited to /x/ in coda position
    /l/ is realized as [ɫ] before back vowels and both /ə/s, and after those vowels in coda position
    /ɦ/ is a very weak glottal transition

    vowels:
      short:
                      FRONT               BACK
                UNROUNDED ROUNDED   UNROUNDED ROUNDED
        CLOSE   e         ø         ɨ         ʉ
         OPEN   a         ə¹        ə²        u
        
      long (long vowels come from historical /Vɰ/ => /Vː/):
                      FRONT               BACK
                UNROUNDED ROUNDED   UNROUNDED ROUNDED
        CLOSE   eː        øː                  uː
         OPEN   aː        əː                  oː
        
    /ə¹/ and /ə²/ are a situation similar to azeri but, like, worse.
    they are both /ə/ but pattern differently for vowel harmony purposes
    
    /e/, /ø/, /ɨ/, /ʉ/, /a/, and /oː/ are near cardinal
    /u/ (and /uː/) are back and slightly lower than cardinal; [u̞]
    
    phrase-final vowels are often devoiced

phonotactics-y stuff:
    - word-final stress
    - strict CV(C) syllable structure. no consonant gemination; the same consonant can't be the coda of a syllable and the onset of the next syllable
    - V(ː)ɦVː gets reduced to Vː

orthography:
    consonants:
        m       n               ň,nh¹
        p/b     t/d     ç/c     (k,q²)/g
        v       s/z     ş/ž³/ř⁴ ħ       h/(unwritten, ǧ⁵)
                l       y
                r

    ¹: <nh> represents /ŋ/ where it was formed from the assimilation of /n/ and disappearance of /x/ in the cluster /nx/. in all other situations <ň> is used. <ň> used to not be used for /ŋ/ arising from assimilations (e.g. you would write <ng> for /ŋg/ instead of <ňg>), but this since changed. note the distinction between <nh> /ŋ/ and <ňh> /ŋh/.
    ²: <q> is used for loan words that originally contained a /q/
    
    ³: taken from the section on phonological changes:
    - one of the sound changes from the proto-language is that /s/ and /z/ palatalize to [ʃ] and [ʒ] before front vowels and in coda position after front vowels. this becomes phonemic after the vowel shift
    -- this change is reflected in the orthography with ş and ž for ʃ and ʒ, but most grammatical suffixes that end in s or z remain written with s and z for two reasons:
    --- 1. they are only pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when the vowel harmony of the suffix generates a front vowel before the s/z
    --- 2. they are not pronounced /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ when followed by another suffix if that causes the s/z to no longer be in coda position (note: a ş/ž in a *root* does not stop being /ʃ/ or /ʒ/ when proceeded by a suffix that causes it to no longer be in coda position. this rule only affects suffixes)
    -- so the shift to /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ can be looked at in two parts, one in roots and one in grammatical suffixes, the latter of which is less of a phonemic distinction and more of an alternation and thus goes unwritten.
    
    ⁴: <ř> for /ʒ/ reflects historical word-initial /ɾ/. never found outside of root-initial position
    ⁵: <ǧ> reflects historical /ɰ/, which has disappeared (except in syllable onset where it is /ɦ/) but has left effects on the vowels.
        for <ı>, <u>, <a>, and <o>, <ǧ> reflects not just the vowel being long but also a different vowel quality.

vowel harmony:
    recap on the vowels:

      long:

    vowel harmony applies to grammatical prefixes and suffixes
    for prefixes, all the vowels of the prefix all harmonize with the following vowel after the prefix
    for suffixes, the first vowel of the suffix harmonizes with the precededing vowel before the suffix, and the subsequent vowels of the suffix rotate a certain direction through vowel space. this will be explained more later
    if an affix is being applied to a root that doesn't have a vowel (some roots are just a single consonant), each vowel harmony type has a cardinal form to use in that case.
    
    in this section we will be using a¹ and a² in the orthography to distinguish /ə¹/ and /ə²/ (and similarly a¹ǧ and a²ǧ for /əː/ and the a² variant of /oː/)
    
    there are 2 forms of vowel harmony: the four-fold system and the two-fold system
    
    in the four-fold system, the vowel agrees with the vowel it's harmonizing with (the "target vowel") in rounding and in either backness (for the close/open vowel class, denoted C and O) or openness (for the front/back vowel class, denoted F and B). this results in 4 possible resulting vowels, hence "four-fold". there are some exceptions when it comes to long vowels due to the long back vowels being defective in roundedness. these exceptions increase the number to 6 possible realizations for the B vowel.

            ca²pçı /dʒə²ptʃɨ/ + -cO => ca²pçıca² /dʒə²ptʃɨdʒə²/

        example: the suffix -BǧnBk:
            ca²pçı /dʒə²ptʃɨ/ + -dFn + -BǧnBk => ca²pçıdiniǧnık /dʒə²ptʃɨdiniːnɨx/
            zie /zeɦa/ + -BǧnBk => *zieeǧna²k => zieǧna²k /zeɦaːnə²x/
            *ç + -BǧnBk => çuǧnuk /tʃuːnʉx/
            *ç + -Os + -BǧnBk => ça²soǧnok /tʃə²soːnux/

    the full four-fold system table therefore looks like this:
    
      target vowel |   C   |   O   |   F   |   B
    ------------------------------------------------
              none |   i   |   a²  |   a¹  | a²/uǧ
                 i |   i   |   e   |   i   |  ı/iǧ
                 ü |   ü   |   a¹  |   ü   |   u
                 ı |  ı/iǧ |   a²  |   i   |   ı
                 u |   u   |   o   |   ü   |   u
                 e |   i   |   e   |   e   | a²/eǧ
                a¹ |   ü   |   a¹  |   a¹  |   o
                a² |   ı   |   a²  |   e   | a²/oǧ
                 o |   u   |   o   |   a¹  |   o

    the two-fold system is rare and is the result of short vowels having dropped out of formerly multi-syllable affixes.
    for example, the suffix -pE used to be -OpF, but over time the O vowel dropped out, except for its influence on the F vowel.
    these two-fold systems only exist in a handful of common affixes. their names come from their default realizations
    
    here is how the E vowel came to be from O+F in the suffix *-OpF => -pE:
    
      target vowel |   O ==F=> E
    --------------------------------
              none |   a²  |   e
                 i |   e   |   e

                a² |   a²  |   e
                 o |   o   |   a¹
    
    here is how the A vowel came to be from B+O in the suffix *-BsOyF => -(s)AyF:
    (note that this does not include the long vowel exceptions to the B vowel because in the suffix it's short)
    
      target vowel |   B ==O=> A
    --------------------------------
              none |   a²  |   a²
                 i |   ı   |   a²

vowel harmony in practice:
    most native roots follow C, O, F, or B harmony left-to-right through the root
    compound words can break harmony, as commonly do loan words, and as do some affixes.
    vowel harmony can also be broken in rare cases in verbs by the reduplication imposed by the frequentative aspect.

grammar:
    nouns:
        nouns decline for the nominative, accusative, oblique, genitive, dative, locative, and instrumental cases.
        the suffixes are as follows:
        
             case    |   suffix    | example declension of a²nha²q "enemy"
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
          nominative | noun-Ø      | a²nha²q "the enemy"
          accusative | noun-(B)r   | a²nha²qa²r "the enemy" (accusative)
             oblique | noun-mB     | a²nha²qma² "the enemy" (oblique)
            genitive | noun-pE     | a²nha²qpe "the enemy's" [more on this below]
              dative | noun-Bd     | a²nha²qa²d "to/for the enemy"
            locative | noun-(s)AyF | a²nha²qa²ye "at the enemy"
        instrumental | noun-OǧFnCk | a²nha²qa²ǧenik "with the enemy"
        
        in the poetic register nouns can be declined for the lative and ablative cases:
             case    |   suffix    | example declension of a²nha²q "enemy"
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
              lative | noun-tF     | a²nha²qte "to the enemy"
            ablative | noun-(O)r   | a²nha²qa²r "from the enemy"

        nouns can mark number with the plural suffix -gI
        
        indefiniteness can be marked with the indefinite marking particle "a²" (derived from the word for 1, "a²y"), which triggers a lenition change on the following consonant, as described in the lenition section:
            ga²ǧa² /goːɦə/ "[the] night"
            a² ca²ǧa² /ə² dʒoːɦə/ "a night"
        the indefinite marker may be elided in poetic registers, leaving just the lenition.
        
        possession is indicated by the "possessed" suffix -nC. the possessor being in genitive case in this situation implies inalienable possession. example:
            ga²ǧa²-pe   ža¹
            night-GEN   life
            "the life of the night"
           
            ga²ǧa²      ža¹-nı
            night       life-POSSD
            "the night's life [alienable]"
           
            ga²ǧa²-pe   ža¹-nı
            night-GEN   life-POSSD
            "the night's life [inalienable]"
        
        there is also an ezafe-like construction used in more formal or poetic registers which can be used to join nouns with other nouns or adjectives.
        it uses the prefix F- on the dependent noun or adjective:
            ža¹-      e-ga²ǧa²
            life      EZ-night
            "the life of the night" / "the life which is of the night"
            
            ža¹-      e-ga²n
            life      EZ-good
            "the life of good" / "the life which is good"
        
        there are a few prefixes that can go on nouns:
             name    |   prefix    | example declension of a²nha²q "enemy"
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
            emphatic |  bC(b)-noun |   bıba²nha²q "the enemy (emphatic)"
           privative |     kC-noun |    kıa²nha²q "the not-enemy"
            "maker"? |     şF-noun |    şea²nha²q "the enemy-maker"
        
        nouns can be turned into verbs that mean "to create [noun]" using the creative suffix -Oz
    
    pronouns:
        some pronouns have lative and ablative forms in addition to the forms for the other cases regular nouns decline for.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        instrumental | sıa²   | ženi   | deni   | degin  | eǧnik  | iǧnik
        
        the 2PL forms are used as formal 2SG pronouns.
        
        there are special inclusive 1PL forms that are formed by adding the prefix dB- (the regular 1PL forms do not specify clusivity):
            za²      "we (incl.)" or "we (excl.)"
            da²za²   "we (incl.)" (etymologically: "you-I")
            zuǧ      "us (incl.)" or "us (excl.)"
            duzuǧ    "us (incl.)" (etymologically: "you-me")
        
        the 3P pronouns can be made into demonstrative pronouns by adding the following suffixes:
            meaning  |   suffix    | examples
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
            proximal | noun-(ǧ)Bm  | eǧa²m, era²m, ea²ǧa²m, eǧnikım
              medial | noun-(ğ)Cy  | eğiy, eriy, ea²ğıy, eğnikiy
              distal | noun-(ǧ)Fǧ  | *eǧeǧ => eǧ, ereǧ, ea²ǧeǧ, eǧnikiǧ
        the medial marks proximity to the listener or to a known 3rd person, but not the speaker.
        
        reflexive pronouns are formed using reduplication:
            sa²         "I"
            sa²sa²      "myself"
            dogda¹      "from you (PL)"
            dodogda¹    "from yourselves"
            ea²s        "for it"
            eea²s       "for itself"
        
        the relative pronouns are reduced forms of the proximal demonstrative pronouns:
                 case    | proximal dem. | relative pronoun
            ------------------------------------------------------------------
              nominative | eǧ            | e
              accusative | ereǧ          | ere
                 oblique | ea²eǧ         | a²e
                genitive | eneyeǧ        | ene
                  dative | teǧ           | te
                locative | kieǧ          | ke
            instrumental | eǧnikiǧ       | eňki
        
        these relative pronouns don't mark relative clauses, but instead are used for the antecedent in the main clause. some examples of sentences with relative clauses:

        interrogative pronouns
        
        most noun marker affixes can be applied to pronouns by use of the auxiliary noun "(ħ)a¹":
            sa² "I"
            büb(ħ)a¹-sa² "I (emphatic)"
        when preceded by a consonant, the ħ may be elided via contraction
        the ezafe construct and the "maker" prefix require the genitive case:
            ža¹-a¹-ħa¹-su "the life which is mine"
            şa¹ħa¹-su "that which makes me"
    
    postpositions:
        lative postposition: lı
        ablative postposition: loda¹
        adverbial postposition: ve (usually unstressed)
        
    
    adjectives:
        attributive adjectives are unmarked except for agreeing in number with the noun they modify using the plural suffix -gI.
        predicative adjectives take all the same case endings as nouns
    
    verbs:
        verbs can be conjugated for person (of both subject and object), number (of subject), tense, aspect, mood, etc.
        there are a number of verbal affixes that mark reflexivity, reciprocity, causativity, directionality, passive voice, etc.
        
        the personal prefixes are sO- for 1P, dO- for 2SG, mB(s)- for 2PL, and Ø-/(h)- for 3P. these apply to the verb in the order [person of object]-[person of subject]-[verb], except in the case of causatives formed from intransitive verbs, where it is somewhat "reversed": [person of causee]-[person of causer]-[verb]-C-Os (note that when -Os follows a vowel it replaces that vowel unless it is i). in causatives formed from transitive verbs, the verb looks like [person of object]-[person of causee]-[person of causer]-[verb]-Os.
        the 3P prefix is Ø- usually but h- when in the position of subject (causer if causativized) and the object (causee if causativized) is 1P, 2SG, or 2PL.
        additionally, the 2nd non-zero personal prefix in the verb drops its vowel (unless succeeded by the 3P as h-).
        
        so, from the root "zie":
            ziece       "to win"
            sezie       "I win"
            dezie       "you win"
            zie         "it wins"
            ziesce      "to make win"
            deszies     "I make you win"
            sezies      "I make it win"
            sedzies     "you make me win"
            sehzies     "it makes me win"
        
        from the root "na²":
            na²ca²          "to see"
            sa²na²ca²       "for me to see"
            na²             "it sees it"
            sa²na²          "I see it"
            da²na²          "you see it"
            da²sna²         "I see you"
            sa²dna²         "you see me"
            sa²hna²         "it sees me"
            da²hna²         "it sees you"
            na²sca²         "to make win"
            da²sda²na²s     "you make me see you"
            da²sa²hna²s     "it makes me see you"
        
        when not already marked using the 2SG/2PL personal distinction, verbs agree in number with the subject (or causee in causativized verbs) using the same plural suffix -gI
        
        the tenses are past, present, and future.
        verbs conjugate for tense and mood. moods:
            indicative - the speaker is stating a fact
            categorical - the speaker is confident that the event has happened/is happening/will happen
            imperative - the speaker is ordering that the event happens
            subjunctive - used in relative clauses for actions that are not factual
            interrogative - the speaker is asking whether the event has happened/is happening/will happen
            optative - the speaker is expressing a wish that the event happen/for the event to happen
            contrafactual - for the condition of a conditional sentence
            conditional - for the dependent clause of a conditional sentence
        
                      |    past    |  present   |   future
        ------------------------------------------------------

          conditional | -(O)l                   | -hO
        
        aspects are marked separate and are more diverse, including:
            - perfective: unmarked
            - imperfective (signifying an event's occurrence over a duration of time): marked with -tBnçi
            - habitual: marked with -lO
            - universal (signifying that the event always happens, or that something is true everywhere or true always): marked with -BǧO
            - frequentative: marked with reduplication; the verb root is modified by adding -(O)r and then adding the first syllable of the verb root, minus any coda consonant (e.g. zie => zierzi)
        
        verbal affixes, in order of application from left to right:
            - interest: kC- (denotes the speaker [and potentially also the listener] holding an interest or stake in the action)
            - aforementioned personal affixes
            - reflexive: zBl- (denotes an action done to oneself; valency-decreasing)
            - reciprocal: zO- (denotes an action done between a group)
            - speaker-away: yC- (denotes movement away from the speaker)
            - speaker-facing: gC- (denotes movement towards the speaker or towards both the speaker and the listener)
            - listener-facing: dCg- (denotes movement towards the listener but not towards the speaker)
            - passive voice: nB- (valency-decreasing)
            - negative: mC-
            - negative (imperative): çOk-

        the tense/mood conjugations of the copula a¹ca¹ "to be" are somewhat irregular:
        
                      |    past    |  present   |   future
        ------------------------------------------------------

    syntax:
        the language is primarily head-final and has free word order (though SOV is the default).
        it is primarily head-marking and highly pro-drop
        
        subjects are put in the nominative, and objects are put in the accusative. verbs mark for person of the subject and the object.
        in causativized sentences, the causee is put in the nominative and the causer is put in the oblique case. the default word for these is first the causee in the nominative, then the object in the accusative, then the causer in the oblique (and then the verb).
        
        multiple subjects or objects can be specified by simply placing multiple subjects/objects in the sentence, all in the nominative/accusative case. there is no need for a conjunction in these cases. however there is a conjunction particle "i" which can be used between subjects or between objects to denote that the subject/object is to be treated as one whole (i.e. for "He married Jane and married Lily.", you wouldn't use the conjunction particle, but for "He married Jane and Lily.", you would)
        
        multiple verbs can be specified using the conjunction suffix -C. each verb in the sentence must carry the suffix.
        
        adjectives can go either before or after the noun they modify, however after is the default.
        
        nouns, adjectives, and non-finite verbs can be made to modify verbs using the adverbial postposition "ve". such adverbial constructs can be placed anywhere in the sentence; there is no default location. nouns can also be made to have adverbial function by placing them in the oblique case, in which case they must come before the verb.
        
        the copula is null in the present indicative/categorical
        
        conditional sentences use the conjunction "to", e.g.:
            sanatı             to     sayadagkoloħ
            Ø-sO-na²-tF        to     sO-yF-dFg-ko-(O)l-(B)ħ
            3-1-see-PST.CNTF   then   1-away-to_you-go-PST.COND-EMPH
            "if I saw it then I would've ran to you" (the emphatic particle turns the verb from having a sense of "coming" to having a sense of "running" or "coming strongly")
