NabancalÄ± (lit. "constructed") is a conlang imagined to be spoken around the middle-east-to-central-asia sprachbund. it takes inspiration from (read: blatantly plagiarizes) turkic languages, north caucasian languages, and hindustani (because those are the languages i have some familiarity with), and the vocabulary is highly perso-arabic-influenced. i don't really have much more to say uh enjoy? i didnt have as much time as i would've liked to work on this so there are probably many many outright mistakes in this document but you can just ignore those

meanings of given words and phrase (+ bonus poem?) at the end of the document, just after the dictionary. also included there are some translations of sentences or whatever. also i translated the north wind and the sun
