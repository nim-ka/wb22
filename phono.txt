phonology:
    consonants:
        m       n               ŋ
        p/b     t/d     tʃ/dʒ   k/g
                s/z     ʃ/ʒ     x       h/ɦ
                l       j
                ɾ
    
    /n/, /t/, /d/, /l/, and /ɾ/ are denti-alveolar
    word-final plosives are devoiced. /k/ and /g/ are lenited to /x/ in coda position
    /l/ is realized as [ɫ] before back vowels except /ə²/
    /ɦ/ is a very weak glottal transition and is on the verge of disappearing

    vowels:
      short:
                      FRONT               BACK
                UNROUNDED ROUNDED   UNROUNDED ROUNDED
        CLOSE   e         ø         ɨ         ʉ
         OPEN   a         ə¹        ə²        u
        
      long (long vowels come from historical /Vɰ/ => /Vː/):
                      FRONT               BACK
                UNROUNDED ROUNDED   UNROUNDED ROUNDED
        CLOSE   eː        øː                  uː
         OPEN   aː        əː                  oː
        
    /ə¹/ and /ə²/ are a situation similar to azeri but, like, worse.
    they are both /ə/ but pattern differently for vowel harmony purposes
    
    /a/ and /aː/ are phonetically front
    
    phrase-final vowels are often devoiced
